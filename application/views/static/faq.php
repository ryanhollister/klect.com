<h2><a name="cost">What does it cost to use KLECT?</a></h2>
<p>KLECT is a free service to use for inventory management, identification, Wishlist, valuation and buying through our Marketplace. The only fee is an optional subscription fee starting at $6 per month that gives users access to sell items on the Marketplace.</p>
<br/>
<h2><a name="safe">Is my personal data safe?</a></h2>
<p>Yes! KLECT is a secure website and system. We use a SSL certificate for the site and an encryption for passwords. Additionally, KLECT does not sell or farm out any personal data, addresses, emails or collection specifics.</p>
<br/>
<h2><a name="spam">Will I get a bunch of SPAM from using KLECT?</a></h2>
<p>NO! We do not subscribe to that and wouldn’t want that ourselves. We do not share email information. The only email that you will get will be Marketplace emails for transactions and the occasional news update from KLECT.</p>
<br/>
<h2><a name="ads">Are there a bunch of ads I have to sift through?</a></h2>
<p>No. We only partner with one or two specific sponsors for a collection community. We strive to keep the screen dedicated to your collection. This also allows you to use KLECT from a wider variety of mobile devices without being slowed down.</p>
<br/>
<h2><a name="money">How does KLECT make money?</a></h2>
<p>KLECT is a new company and we generate our revenue from the online subscriptions we sell to users that want to sell items from their inventory on our Marketplace.</p>
<br/>
<h2><a name="new_collection">I don’t see what I like to collect on KLECT yet, why?</a></h2>
<p>KLECT is constantly looking to add new collectable communities to our system. Email us at contact@klect.com with your suggestions. If your interested in working with us to bring a new collection online, let us know as that can speed things up!</p>
<br/>
<h2><a name="wish_list">Why should I set up a Wishlist?</a></h2>
<p>Lots of good reasons. First, you can email the list to yourself and share it with those who might be looking for just the right gift this year for you . Also, by setting your Wishlist, whenever one of those items become posted in the Marketplace, you will get an instant email to notify you so you can decide if you want to buy it. In essence, the Wishlist is keeping an eye out for you so you don’t miss that opportunity to get one of those missing items!</p>
<br/>
<h2><a name="hide_from_marketplace">Why should I use the ‘Hide from Marketplace Views’ feature?</a></h2>
<p>While you might not plan to sell any of your collection today, you might decide to sell off a duplicate or two sometime later. Most collectors have their core collection that we won’t ever part with, those are the ones you wouldn’t want to show up in your view when you go to select an item for sale. Using this will also be a benefit later when we release our Trade Matching system to help you find more opportunities to fill your collection out. If youre already usint KLECT to sell in the Marketplace, then using this will streamline your selling even further.</p>
<br/>
<h2><a name="value_from">How does KLECT get their values for items? I don’t agree with some of them.</a></h2>
<p>Value is a tricky topic. We work with specific super users in a community to provide input for value, and we try and incorporate what current sales prices we get. Values are estimates to help you see an estimate of your total collection and provide some guide for any transactions you might look at. With thousands of items and values, we won’t match up to any annual published guide or other publications. If you feel we have a particular item way off base, please let us know. We will have it reviewed and update if approved.
<br/><br/>
<h2><a name="missing_photos">I noticed some photos of items are missing. Can I submit a picture to help??</a></h2>
<p>Absolutely! We rely on the community to help us fill in the missing photos. We strive to get the best images we can and can offer by line thanks. For our more active contributors, they can earn free time in the Marketplace too!</p>
<br/>
<h2><a name="picture_format">What is the best format to submit pictures?</a></h2>
<p>KLECT.com does its best to build our catalog with high quality photos of items. With the vast number of items in collections, it is impossible for us to take pictures of every item. Therefore our users are encouraged to submit pictures of items we do not have or higher quality pictures than the ones we do. <br/><br/>To make images fit the current layout of the site best, it needs to be a 4:3 ratio. This means a landscape picture (more wide and tall). Ideally, it would be 200 pixels wide by 175 pixels tall. But any resolution bigger than that with a 4:3 ratio is perfectly acceptable. We appreciate all the support our users show us by taking the time to submit their own photos.</p>
