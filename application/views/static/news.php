<h2><a name="29032011">29 Mar 2011</a></h2> <p>US Stamps Official Launch<br/><br/>
Austin, Texas - What is typically 22 cm by 18.5 cm, decorative, commemorative and can be a snapshot of United States History? A stamp. 35% of the World's population can immediately connect Scott Number C3a with the image of what is considered by some to be the most prized error in philately, the Inverted Jenny. There are libraries, catalogues, software packages and volumes of books dedicated to the more than 400,000 types of stamps. However, there are no comprehensive, mobile systems that allow collectors to enjoy their hobby on the run while also alleviating the stressors associated with selling, buying and tracking their collection.
<br/><br/>
Austin start-up, KLECT Corp., has begun bridging this gap with the debut of their Airmail catalogue. Their next addition, US Postage stamps, will be debuted at the American Stamp Dealers Association's stamp show in New York City on April 7, 2011. KLECT will provide collectors with a comprehensive place to manage their collections, and enable them to buy and sell in a secure environment. Only the selling function of the web site requires a subscription. Otherwise, KLECT's membership and services are free!
